This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with various aspects of Data Engineering, focusing on the practical application of different operators, scheduling methods and some advanced concepts.

Core Components and Examples:
- **Branching with branch_operator_dag**</br>Implement branching operators to control the flow of execution based on specific conditions.

- **Dataset Scheduling with consumer and producer DAGs**</br>Utilize the dataset method for new scheduling techniques to handle dependencies and trigger tasks in a data-driven approach.

- Grouping and Task Management with group_dag and task_dag: Practice grouping tasks as subDAGs and using task groups for better organization and parallel execution within workflows.

- Custom Plugins with elastic_dag: Develop custom plugins and integrate with Elasticsearch for dynamic data querying and indexing.

- Cross-Communication with xcom_dag: Explore cross-communication between tasks using XCom to pass and share results.

- Parallel Execution with parallel_dag: Test the parallel processing capabilities of tasks across different nodes using a Celery worker for efficient workload management.
